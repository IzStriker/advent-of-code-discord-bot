# advent-of-code-discord-bot

instead of doing advent of code I did this. idk why.
[https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1047611666604503061&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1047611666604503061&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

Todo:
 - [ x ]: poll each guild for leaderboard data every 15 mins (for current year)
 - [ x ]: get leaderboard data from cache if applicable
 - [ x ]: add commands to plot leaderboard progress
